Introduction:
Hello and welcome to this repository! Here you will find a list of all the React Projects I've worked on


How to Run
React is kinda tricky to run from your editor, there are a few steps you must follow:

1. Clone this repository into VS Code Command Line Interface(CLI)...
2. CD into the project you wish to view.
3. Run npm i  (this will install all the dependencies for the project)
4. Run npm start > This will open live Development Evironment where you can view and edit.
5. That's it repeat for other projects. Happy Viewing! ðŸ˜‰
