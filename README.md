Introduction:
Hello and welcome to this repository! Here you will find a list of all the React Projects I've worked on
Learn about why I'm so passionate about React JS and how this framework makes the software development 
process more collaborative and seemless. Let's talk about why you should consider using React for your next project.
Welcome to my portfolio. From experimental passion projects to commissioned work for clients, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity
to create a variety of projects for this dynamic industry. I thrive on creative challenges and enjoy building strong
relationships along the way. Explore my work below, and contact me directly to learn more.

How to Run
React is kinda tricky to run from your editor, there are a few steps you must follow:

1. Clone this repository into VS Code Command Line Interface(CLI)...
2. CD into the project you wish to view.
3. Run npm i  (this will install all the dependencies for the project)
4. Run npm start > This will open live Development Evironment where you can view and edit.
5. That's it repeat for other projects. Happy Viewing! ðŸ˜‰
